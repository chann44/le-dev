TypeScript offers a variety of utility types to work with. One of these is the `Omit` utility type, which allows us to remove certain properties from types.


### How does it work ?

The `Omit` utility type takes a type and properties as arguments, then removes them from the given type. For instance, if you have a type `UserResponse`:


```typescript
type UserResponse = {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    age: number;
    createdAt: string;
    updatedAt: string
}

```

And you want to remove createdAt and updatedAt, you can use the Omit utility type as follows:

```typescript
type User = Omit<UserResponse, "createdAT" | "updatedAt">
```

Now, `createdAt` and `updatedAt` are no longer part of the `User` type.

I hope this helps clarify the usage of the `Omit` utility type in TypeScript.
