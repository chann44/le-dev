Hey everyone! It's been ages since I wrote here—2024's here, and it's time to share what's up!

I've been stuck with frontend stuff for a while now. Don't get me wrong, I love working with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind, but lately, it's felt a bit dull.

So, what's new?

`Learning Go`: Jumping into Go has been super exciting! It's different from what I'm used to, but it's cool. I'll share all about it here.

`New Blog with Astro`: I'm planning to redo this blog using something called Astro. It's supposed to make things fancier—let's see how it goes.

`Trying Web3`: It's been a while since I've built in this space, so I want to get back into it and contribute to some awesome projects

`Weekly Blog Posts`: Starting a new habit! I'll be posting a blog every week, sharing updates and thoughts on my learning journey.

That's the plan! Keep an eye out for more updates. Let's keep it real and fun. Here's to learning and making 2024 awesome!

Catch you later,
