It's 4 am, and I'm excited to share what I've been working on this week!

Currently between jobs after leaving Tiny API a week ago, I've been exploring new opportunities. During my search, I stumbled upon <a href="https://vuejobs.com/" target="_blank">VueJobs</a> and <a href="https://sveltejobs.com/" target="_blank">Svelte Jobs</a>, niche job boards catering to developers with specific tech stacks like Vue.js or Svelte.

Inspired by this, I decided to create a React job board. As a loyal member of the React community, I felt the existing options were lacking the cool factor.

# Yes! I'm Building a Job Board!

## Features

Here's a glimpse of what I envision:

1. **Developer Ratings**: Implementing a rating system akin to Discord bots or polls. However, I'm aware of potential exploitation, so I'm actively seeking solutions to address this challenge.

2. **Moderation**: Profiles undergo a thorough review process to ensure authenticity. A robust system will evaluate and decide if a person is hireable. This ensures that only genuine candidates are visible to recruiters.

3. **Consultant Registration**: Catering to agencies or freelancers, making it easy for them to post jobs and connect with potential candidates.

4. **Job Filters**: Implementing filters for job searches to enhance the user experience.

This is the initial concept, and I'd love to hear your feedback on <a href="https://twitter.com/44_chann" target="_blank" >twitter</a>. If you're interested in contributing, check out the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/chann44/React-jobs" target="_blank">here</a>

Let's build something great together!
